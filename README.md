### BIOS

Version F12

- Fast Boot: `Disabled`
- CSM: `Disabled`
- Above 4G Decoding: `Enabled`
- Resizable Bar Support: `Enabled`
- PCIe slot speed: `Auto`
- XMP Profile activated

## Usage

1. [Update `PlatformInfo/Generic` stuff](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#generate-a-new-serial) with your own, inside `config.plist`
2. Use your Ethernet‚Äôs MAC address for `ROM` value, as explained in the Dortania guide. Don‚Äôt leave it as all 0s.
3. Update value of `brcmfx-country` argument in `NVRAM/7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82/boot-args` with your country code. Should be identical or compatible with what your WiFi router is broadcasting. (Remove the parameter if you don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about here.)
4. Turn off Power Nap in Energy Saver.

### What‚Äôs working

Everything.

- CPU Power Management.
- NVMe SSD.
- WiFi, Bluetooth, Ethernet.
- All USB ports (without map, just with RHUB reset).
- Radeon GPU is natively supported.
- 4K HDMI or DisplayPort with HDR.
- Watch unlock, Handoff, iMessage, iCloud, Keychain, Xcode etc.
- System Integrity Protection (SIP) fully enabled.
- Sleep / Wake.
- All media & DRM

### What‚Äôs not working

Sidecar most likely. Did not even try it but I suspect it does not work.

## Notes

Use at your own risk. 

- All `.efi` drivers and `.kext` are `-RELEASE` builds from the respective packages. 
- OpenCanopy (GUI boot menu) is up and running.
- I don‚Äôt boot Windows 10 using OC, thus I can‚Äôt guarantee it will work. I have Win 10 installed on separate SSD and switch using Boot Menu.

**Don‚Äôt ask me for help.** Sorry but this stuff is finicky and infuriatingly detailed that every little mis-step can be a proper headache. This is why [Dortania](https://dortania.github.io) advises to not reuse anyone‚Äôs EFI.  

Ask [on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/) and the [discord server](https://discord.gg/Wxam8aH).

Good luck.
