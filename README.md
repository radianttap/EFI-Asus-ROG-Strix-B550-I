### BIOS

Version 2803

- Fast Boot: `Disabled`
- CSM: `Disabled`
- Above 4G Decoding: `Enabled`
- Resizable Bar Support: `Enabled`
- PCIe slot speed: `Gen3`
- XMP Profile activated (D.O.C.P.)

## Usage

1. [Update `PlatformInfo/Generic` stuff](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#generate-a-new-serial) with your own, inside `config.plist`
2. Use your Ethernet‚Äôs MAC address for `ROM` value, as explained in the Dortania guide. Don‚Äôt leave it as all 0s.

## Notes

Use at your own risk. 

- All `.efi` drivers and `.kext` are `-RELEASE` builds from the respective packages. 
- OpenCanopy (GUI boot menu) is up and running.
- I don‚Äôt boot Windows 10 using OC, thus I can‚Äôt guarantee it will work. I have Win 10 installed on separate SSD and switch using Boot Menu.

**Don‚Äôt ask me for help.** Sorry but this stuff is finicky and infuriatingly detailed that every little mis-step can be a proper headache. This is why [Dortania](https://dortania.github.io) advises to not reuse anyone‚Äôs EFI.  

Ask [on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/) and the [discord server](https://discord.gg/Wxam8aH).

Good luck.
